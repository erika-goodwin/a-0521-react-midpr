This is the react application to check the weather and record your health condition such as headache, joint pain, etc in relation to the weather condition at the time. You can also check the local time of the city. The weather data is fetched from Weather API - OpenWeatherMap. The database and authorization system use firebase.

### Why did I make this?

I was learning basics of React hook, React router, and Redux at the time. My teacher informed me that there are many APIs we can use for free and showed me what we can do. This led me to try using API myself. Furthermore, after I learned how to make a backend side and authorization function with Node.js, I upgraded this weather app with firebase's database and authorization services. The intent of the memo feature is to be able to track your personal health with the weather. The idea originated from my personal experience of being prone to headaches myself.

### What was challenging?

I always try to use a language or tool that I have never used before as I believe practice helps expand my knowledge. While I was working on this project, I was struggling with routes. As a result, I chose to add an additional page and became more familiar with it.

### What did I learn from this project?

I learned how to use design framework to speed up the design portion from this project. When I try a new language or tool, I want to focus on learning the basic rules before starting to read codes. It will help me better understand and have fun with all the processes. For this purpose, using the CSS framework helped me save time with a simple and responsive design.
